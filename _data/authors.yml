  bio: I am a first-year PhD-student in Economics at the University of Glasgow. My research interest lies in Behavioural Economics. I am both psyched on theoretical (mathematical modelling) and empirical methods. I currently work on how people may find it optimal to develop a "tunnel-vision" and which factors influence this. Generally, I find all studies investigating how people allocate attention interesting, but also other psychological biases influencing processes of decision-making.
  interests: <ul><li>Website building</li><li>Quantitative data analysis (language as data)</li><li>Python</li><li>LaTex</li></ul>

  bio: Spurr submitted his PhD in late 2015, and successfully defended his thesis, "Amateur Video&#58; Technology, Behaviour and Practice 1965-2015", in early 2016 at the Theatre, Film and Television subject area, University of Glasgow.<br>His research was focused primarily on the diffusion and implications of early amateur and industrial video-recording technology for the UK amateur movie making sector (a network of independent film makers and regional cine clubs) between 1965 and 2015.<br>The PhD used extensive historical and technical knowledge to explore the under-conceptualised relation between magnetic recording technology and amateur movie-making/videography in the period outlined. It utilised an exploratory methodology, combining oral history, archival research, cultural analysis and close textual reading, in producing an 'immersive' and novel historical account.
  interests: <ul><li>Digitization and historiography, and the relationship between the two.</li><li>Microhistorical approaches to technology.</li></ul>
